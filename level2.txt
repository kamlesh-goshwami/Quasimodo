Plato is the earliest
 important educational thinker, and education is
 an essential elementin "The Republic" (his most important 
work on philosophy and political theory, written around 360 B.C.). In it, he
 advocates some rather extreme methods: removing children from their mothers' 
care and raising them as wards of the state and differentiating children suitable 
to the various castes, the highest receiving the most education, so that they could act
 as guardians of the city and care for the less able. He believed that education should
 be holistic, including facts, skills, physical discipline, music and art. Plato believed that talent and intelligence is not distributed genetically and thus is be found in children born to all classes, although his proposed system of selective public education for an educated minority of the population does not really follow a democratic model.
